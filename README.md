# Zircon Scala Skeleton Project

This is a skeleton project for Zircon users that can be used to get started with Zircon.

## Getting started

This project works on all platforms but there are some prerequisites that must be installed
before you can start coding.

1. *Git.* (optional)
    Git is a version control system. If you use GitHub you are already familiar with it.
    You don't need extensive Git knowledge to work with this project, but you need to install Git
    on your system if you want to clone / fork this project. You can get it [here](https://git-scm.com/).
    Alternatively you can download the zip / tarball from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon.skeleton.scala/releases).
2. *Java*
    This project uses Scala, so you must install a Java *JDK* to get started. We suggest [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)
    but any other JDK will do. Java 8 or above is recommended.

That's all!

## Setting up

In order to set up a local dev environment on your computer you need to follow these steps:

### Check the project out (optional)

If you want to use Git to clone the project you need to navigate to a folder where you want
to check the project out in a terminal and type the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon.skeleton.scala.git
```
Alternatively you can just download and extract the latest release form the [Releases page](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon.skeleton.scala/releases).

### Import the project to your IDE

We recommend setting up Zircon Scala Skeleton Project with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/):

1. Download and install latest [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
2. Install official [Scala plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala) for IntelliJ
3. In the IntelliJ welcome screen choose `Open` (or select `File` â†’ `Open...` from the IntelliJ
   menu) and navigate to `zircon.skeleton.scala` directory
4. After IntelliJ has finished syncing project files open `Main.scala` file avaiable at:
   ```
   src/main/scala/com/example/Main.scala
   ```
5. Click the green arrow to the left of `object Main extends App` line to build and run sample
   Zircon application
6. Have fun!
